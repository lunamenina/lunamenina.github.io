The Pacific Northwest loves the canine companionship, and it makes a lot of sense. 

The region’s love for dogs is inseparable from its love for the great outdoors. The luscious forests covering the upper left corner of America; the majestic mountains calling for the adventurous spirits; thousands of turquoise, jade green, and milky blue alpine lakes whispering into the urban dweller’s hearts.  

But I haven't had the luxury of knowing what it's like to be with dogs. I only have a cat. 

So every time I see a happy border collie running through the muddy trails that lead to a breathtaking view of the Cascades, or an excited golden retriever diving into a cool swimming hole, surrounded by the wild summer blooms, I wonder if my indoor cat is missing out. Considering how timid and risk-averse she is, she will never have a chance to feel the emotional rush of being on the top of the world, and she will never be able to unleash her predatory instinct when encountering a squirrel, or a bird in the woods. Is she perfectly okay with her timid self? Is she aware of her laziness and outrageous sleeping schedule? Is she enjoying her apartment lifestyle, that’s so disconnected from how her ancestors lived? 

And every time I see a clumsy corgi climbing up the stairs in an office building, or a tired French bulldog, falling asleep outside of a coffee shop, again, I wonder what all the cats in the city are up to. Are they being worshipped for their unproductivity and nonchalance? Do they spend their entire life indoor as well? Do they yearn for the outdoors? 

Seattle certainly boasts about her tremendous love for dogs, but so does our mainstream culture. After all, the image of a puppy rolling happily on its back, represents a good life, full of love and friendships, energy and adventures. 

But what about cats? Are they the secondary choice for apartment dwellers who can’t afford dogs? Are they the ultimate comfort to the loners, the outsiders, and the introverts? Or are they the deified creatures that the Internet is crazy about? My college girl friends have always casually joked about turning into some old cat ladies, when complaining about their dating lives, and we’d all laugh and cheer each other up, saying it’s actually a pretty good prospect. But we know that secretly, we all dreaded the possibility of the joke turning into reality. At the same time, we do envy the cat’s way of life, the effortless elegance, the undeniable independence, the mysterious aloofness, and the flirtatious warmness. Words can’t quite describe the cat’s way of life, perhaps, it’s just a cat being a cat. 

A cat perching on the sunny balcony, idly watching over the city streets – it’s just a cat being a cat; A cat walking over your computer keyboard, demanding your attention, when you are trying to do work – it’s just a cat being a cat; A cat sitting alertly at the window, teeth clattering, ready to pounce towards the birds flying by – it’s just a cat being a cat; A cat sensing her human companion’s emotional neediness, laying her head gently against the cheek covered in running tears, and starting to purr – it’s just a cat being a cat. 

Maybe we like to picture ourselves running by the city’s water front with our dogs, feeling healthy and happy, and we like to think that one day, we will have that spacious dream house filled with light, with a backyard where the dogs can run free. But on those rainy winter nights when you come home to your dark apartment, when you are too tired to even make a grilled cheese sandwich, when you are feeling whatever you feel that makes you want to curl up and cry, there’s your little feline friend, sitting at the entrance, waiting for you, and her dinner. You’d pick her up, and she’d cry with a slight annoyance; She’d rub her head against your feet, and you’d open a tuna can for her. You’d order Chinese takeout and watch Friends or Frasier for the fiftieth time, and she’d sit next to you, and start washing her face. She might run away from you when you try to pet her after she just cleaned herself up, but she would never make fun of you, for watching the same stupid sit-com over and over again, instead of going to the gym, having a real hobby, or meeting some new people. 

On one early summer Saturday afternoon, it suddenly dawned on me that maybe we love dogs for being with us, but we adore cats for being cats. As I was taking a long walk around the city, I noticed a handsome black cat sitting on the balcony that seems to look over the beautiful Elliot Bay, then I noticed a huge Maine Coon poking her head through the closed curtain of a basement ceiling window, and I looked up at the thousands of city windows, dimly lit, half shut, like thousands of quizzical cat eyes filled with unspoken wisdom. I think I might be seeing so many cat trees standing by those windows, so many cats sunbathing in their hammocks, and I am not sure, if the cats see me too. 

And I suppose for most of the city cats, they may never get to go outside to explore the urban jungle, or travel afar to the wilderness, but in a way, they have figured it all out -- instead of walking all over the city, you could also just sit there, and let the city walk pass you; and instead of looking for answers in the mountain breezes, you could also ask yourself the hard question: can you love yourself, for just being you?
