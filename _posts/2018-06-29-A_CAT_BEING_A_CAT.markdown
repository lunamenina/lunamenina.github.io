The Pacific Northwest loves the canine companionship, and it makes a lot of sense. 

The region’s love for dogs is inseparable from its love for the great outdoors. The luscious forests covering the upper left corner of America; the majestic mountains calling for the adventurous spirits; thousands of turquoise, jade green, and milky blue alpine lakes whispering into the urban dweller’s hearts.  

But every time I see a happy border collie running through the muddy trails that lead to a breathtaking view of the Cascades, or an excited golden retriever diving into a cool swimming hole, surrounded by the wild summer blooms, I wonder if my indoor cat is missing out. Considering how timid and risk-averse she is, she will never have a chance to feel the emotional rush of being on the top of the world, and she will never be able to unleash her predatory instinct when encountering a squirrel, or a bird in the woods. Is she perfectly okay with her timid self? Is she aware of her laziness and unproductivity? Is she enjoying her apartment lifestyle, that’s so disconnected from how her ancestors lived? 

And every time I see a clumsy corgi climbing up the stairs in an office building, or a tired French bulldog, falling asleep outside of a coffee shop, again, I wonder what all the cats in the city are up to. Are they being worshipped for their laziness and nonchalance? Do they spend their entire life indoor as well? Do they yearn for the outdoors? 

Seattle certainly boasts about her tremendous love for dogs, but so does our mainstream culture. After all, the image of a puppy rolling happily on its back, represents a good life, full of love and friendships, energy and adventures. 

But what about cats? Are they the secondary choice for apartment dwellers who can’t afford dogs? Are they the ultimate comfort to the loners, the outsiders, and the introverts? Or are they the deified creatures that the Internet is crazy about? My college girl friends have always casually joked about turning into some old cat ladies, when complaining about their dating lives, and we’d all laugh and cheer each other up, saying it’s actually a pretty good prospective. But we know that secretly, we all dreaded the possibility of the joke turning into reality. At the same time, we do envy the cat’s way of life, the effortless elegance, the undeniable independence, the mysterious aloofness, and the flirtatious warmness. Words can’t quite describe the cat’s way of life, perhaps, it’s just a cat being a cat. 

A cat perching on the sunny balcony, idly watching over the city streets – it’s just a cat being a cat; A cat walking over your computer keyboard, demanding your attention, when you are trying to do work – it’s just a cat being a cat; A cat sitting alertly at the window, teeth clattering, ready to pounce towards the birds flying across – it’s just a cat being a cat; A cat sensing her human companion’s sadness, laying her head gently against the cheek covered in running tears, and starting to purr – it’s just a cat being a cat. 

Maybe we like to picture ourselves running by the city’s water front with our dogs, feeling healthy and happy, and we all like to think that one day, we will have that spacious dream house filled with light, with a backyard where the dogs can run free. But on those rainy winter nights when you come home to your dark apartment, when you are too tired to even make a grilled cheese sandwich, when you are feeling whatever you feel that you want to curl up and cry, there’s your little feline friend, sitting at the entrance, waiting for you, and her dinner. You’d pick her up, and she’d cry with a slight annoyance; She’d rub her head against your feet, and you’d open a canned tuna for her. You’d order Chinese takeout and watch Friends or Frasier for the fiftieth time, and she’d sit next to you, and start washing her face. She might run away from you when you try to pet her after she just cleaned herself up, but she would never make fun of you, for watching the same stupid sit-com over and over again, instead of going to the gym, having a real hobby, and meeting some new people. 

On one early summer Saturday afternoon, as I took a long walk around the city, I noticed a handsome black cat sitting on the balcony that likely looks over the beautiful Elliot Bay, then I noticed a majestic Maine Coon poking her head through the closed curtain of a basement ceiling window, and I looked up at the thousands of city windows, dimly lit, half shut, and I couldn’t keep track of how many of those have a cat tree standing inside. It suddenly dawned on me, maybe the city loves cats, too, if not more. 

Maybe the ancient debate about cats vs. dogs are saying something about ourselves. 
We all want to fit right in, and be fun, outgoing, loving, and loved, just like our canine friends. But I guess there is the uncomfortable question we have to ask ourselves: if we adore our cats for just being cats, can we love ourselves too, for just being ourselves?
