I used to love people watching, a lot. 
<br />
<br />
Ever since I got Luna, a half Siamese, half Snowshoe mix, I sort of ditched my old pastime hobby, as I realized that the cat is so much more fascinating to watch than humans. 
<br />
<br />
I'd watch her basking in the summer sun, with her eyes half shut, and her silver fur shimmering gloriously. She sits in her own shadow, and seems so careless, lazy, yet majestic. She yawns. Long and Powerful. In that soft yawn, there's a spark of ferocity, a fierce soul, buried deep. Eventually, she rolls over, and stretches herself over the world, like the long summer day, extending from early morning to late night. 
<br />
<br />
I seriously think, that this cat has mastered the art of manipulation. Or perhaps all cats have. 
When we first met, she was forbidden from the sacred bedroom. But now there is no prohibited land for her. It is her kingdom. She occupies the highest point of the space, a throne at the top of a cat tree, which I happily bought and assembled for her. She roams freely across the isolated dark realm underneath the bed. She claims ownership of the human bed, the laundry baskets, my lap, and my belly. She reserves the right to inspect all the packages and groceries I brought back. She accepts affection, attention and catnips condescendingly, and ignores them, except catnips, when she demands solitude. 
<br />
<br />
Later on, I think I discovered one of her main techniques. It's the way she talks, like the sea, waves on top of waves, tides rising and falling, heartwarming like a mother's cradle, heartbreaking like a baby's cry. And somehow, she has trained me, that a high pitched squeak means contempt and annoyance, a soft sweet cry means satisfaction and playfulness, and the loud melodic ones, oh those are the evil ones. They are intricate and delicate, as if she intentionally rolled her tongue, to make it sound almost French. Those are clear messages, when she wants something from you, right at this moment. 
<br />
<br />
I unwillingly admit, that mastering the techniques, is a very different thing than mastering the art. But even if I am able to decipher all her wizardry of manipulation, I am powerless. 
<br />
<br />
So I let her rule, as she rewards me with her openly exposed belly, her steady head rubbing, and her mellow purring. 
Some people describe their fluffy companions as "a pure bundle of joy". 
<br />
<br />
As Luna falls asleep quietly by my side, in her queen-size human bed, I do feel the joy, of two perhaps lonely souls connecting mysteriously. And every day, I thank the universe for working its magic, in some incomprehensible, yet marvelous way. But Luna is more than a bundle of joy, she is a bundle of many, many things to me. 
<br />
<br />

I hope to be writing more about Luna here. This is just a start of the journey, to unravel a fascinating feline soul, to the human world.
