It is the year of 2020. It is almost April. And it is a strange time.
<br />
<br />
For too long, the society has forced the introverts to adapt to the extroverts’ way of living – be loud and visible – it’s like a fake-it-till-you-mean-it kind of game, tolerable, uncomfortable, if not painful.
<br />
<br />
But now it’s a different kind of game. The new social norm of stay-at-home may be driving all the party animals insane, but perhaps for the first time in life, to an introvert, it feels … home.
<br />
<br />
No more obligatory friendly smiles in the elevators; no more small talks in the office break room; no more awkward excuses when you decline yet another social invite because you’d rather order Thai take-out and watch The Office; and no more self-loathing when you realize you basically have no social life, while hearing the mockery inside your own head: Geez, guess whose fault is that?
<br />
<br />
You think to yourself, this all works out quite well. A little strange, but not unexpected.
<br />
<br />
You’d start the day making some waffles, with the batter recipe getting ever more intricate by day. A simple milk, egg, oil, and flour quartet quickly turns into a jazz band, infused with splashes of vanilla and almond extract, with sprinkles of poppy seeds and cinnamon swirled in, accentuated by the nuttiness of pecans and walnuts, elevated by the sweetness of bananas and ginger spiced syrup, and topped with a handful of blueberries, happily rolling around, rising to a crescendo.
<br />
<br />
You decide that you need some John Coltrane in the background, to go with such a heavenly breakfast. Then you spend a few minutes contemplating if you should get an espresso machine at home, for you do miss the macchiato from the coffee place downstairs. You let yourself slip into a pointless self-debate, but quickly concede that you can make do with your very functioning coffee maker, for now.
<br />
<br />
You check your work emails, and at 10 o’clock in the morning, the chat room is still quiet, so you bond with your feline friend a bit more, take more pictures of her adorable little paws, and marvel at how lazy she is. Moments later, when your cat shows clear boredom towards you, you let her go, knowing that she’d be stepping all over your keyboard during one of your remote meetings, later in the afternoon.
<br />
<br />
Adopting a lighter diet seems easier too, because you really aren’t moving much. Skipping a full lunch meal, and snacking on celeries and carrots with hummus, feels less dreadful, and even a little delightful. You have stocked up your pantry with canned tuna fish, frozen peas, and different shapes of pasta, and you realize how much you relish the greenness of spinach, crispness of lettuce, and the slight bitterness of kale. You somehow begin to remember your ten-year-old self, vehemently refusing to eat vegetables, and with a pang of nostalgia, you remind yourself that you have been an adult, for years.
<br />
<br />
You are all into those self-loving and self-caring rituals now. As you spend all day every day at your little apartment, you are determined to get even cozier. Hence the scented candles, the knitted blankets, the warm socks, the oversized sweatshirt, and the endlessly streaming Netflix. You start to feel good about yourself, and surprisingly motivated to stay active. Since you can no longer go to your HIIT sessions after work, or show up at the barre studio on weekends, you start out with a goal of doing 100 burpees every day, but quickly end up compromising to maybe 30 push-ups, with occasional online yoga videos.
<br />
<br />
You have also had time to pick up some old hobbies. You now spend hours playing ragtime, tinkering with electronics, observing and drawing. And in the same spirit, you end up watching The Lord of the Rings again, and then Star Wars, and eventually Indiana Jones. You’ve always wanted to do that – binge watching all the classics, on one of those dreary winter days, when the wind blows outside, and the fireplace crackles by your side. Though all those years you have never had a fireplace, and on most dreary winter weekends, you have opted to be out on the slope skiing, you are finally having the ultimate movie marathon, and it’s just as good as you have always imagined.
<br />
<br />
You have always complained about having no time or space for introspection, but now that you have plenty, you decide to avoid such ordeal, which might just lead to another episode of quarter-life crisis mental breakdown. Instead, you pick up the book that you are almost half way through, and settle into your indoor hammock, knowing that two seconds later, your cat will jump up and start purring on your stomach. Meanwhile, you will probably doze off a bit, taking the fictional world of medieval kings and knights, sailors and merchants, into your unchartered dreamland.
<br />
<br />
When you are ready to say good night to another day of self-quarantine, you casually scroll through everyone’s Instagram stories, because social media is still a mild addition to you. You realize that the familiar images you see, are many, many other isolated tiny worlds, filled with cats and dogs, cooking and baking, indoor workout selfies and superfoods smoothie recipes , online book club reading lists, daily doodles of house plants, half-completed puzzles, and inspirational quotes … you sigh, but quickly reconcile with yourself – maybe you are being cliché, or bourgeois, or whatever. But in this strange time, when the news makes it feel like the world is spinning out of control, maybe everyone is beginning to grasp the new meanings in small things. And to your great amusement, as an introvert, you feel connected with the strangers out there. Because the taste of grains and nuts, the aroma of herbs and flowers, the everchanging shades of the sky, and the sound of the season changing ... those are wonderful things to discover, and rediscover.
