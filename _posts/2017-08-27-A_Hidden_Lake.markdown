<br /> 
I am a city girl, and a proud one, too. 
The dazzling windows in the department stores; The sophisticated people talking about sophisticated matters in the cafes; The office girls walking out of the subway station with their shiny stilettos, carrying handbags with the distinct Louis Vuitton logo printed all over. The city, is who we are. The sophistication of the city is our sophistication; the great taste of the city is our great taste; the success of the city is our success. 

So all my friends and I grew up, learned all those luxurious designer brands early, and our pastime, often times, was just loitering in the fancy malls, admiring the beaufiul models on the advertisement boards, trying all the free perfume sample on our wrists, and thinking to ourselves, one day we will all grow up to be classy and posh!

I never felt like I missed out anything growing up. After all, I had seen all the fine things in the city. 
Yet one afternoon, in an arboretum in Idaho, five hours away from Seattle, I saw a little brown bunny, hopping across the green field. He had his long ears up, listening intently for a moment, and disappeared into the woods. I saw his little tail, like a small, white snow ball, just like how they descibed it in the storybooks. 

All of a sudden, I felt jealous. 
I had never seen a wild bunny before.
