My name is Samantha. Luna is my cat.

We both really love to eat, sleep, daydream.

We both prefer people watching to socializing.

We both like keyboards, shiny things, electronics.

I think we are very much alike. 

Although she is more philosophical, 

and probably a better code too, if she wants to be.
