My name is Samantha. 
Luna is my cat. 
We both really love to eat, sleep, daydream. 
We both prefer people watching to actual socializing. 
We both tend to stay up late and sneak out food from the kitchen. 
We both like keyboards, shiny things, electronics. 
I think we are very much alike, although Luna might disagree.
She is probably more philosophical. 
Probably a better coder too, if she wants to be.
